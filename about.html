      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m <strong>Mohamed Ali Suliman Salih</strong>, a Civil Engineer and certified Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) professional with a passion for creating safer, more resilient workplaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hold a <strong>Diploma in Fire and Construction Safety Management</strong>, alongside international certifications such as <strong>NEBOSH, IOSH, OSHA</strong>, and the <strong>State Professional Certificate in Security Risk Management (STPM-C)</strong>. 
        My hands-on experience includes working with the <strong>Ministry of Infrastructure and Urban Development</strong> and <strong>Plan International Sudan</strong>, where I contributed to project planning, field supervision, and safety compliance.
      </p>
      <p>
        My expertise focuses on <strong>HSE leadership, risk assessment, and safety supervision</strong>, ensuring that operations meet both local and international safety standards. 
        I believe safety isn’t just about compliance — it’s about building a proactive culture of care, accountability, and trust.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m currently expanding my skills in <strong>Project Management</strong> and <strong>Occupational Safety Auditing</strong> through continuous learning programs such as PMP Essentials and ISO 45001 Lead Auditor training. 
        My long-term goal is to grow into a senior role in <strong>HSE and Risk Management</strong> within large-scale infrastructure or humanitarian projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of work, I enjoy learning about new technologies, improving leadership skills, and connecting with professionals who share a passion for safety and innovation.
